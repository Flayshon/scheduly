# Scheduly
![scheduly-build-workflow](https://github.com/Flayshon/scheduly/workflows/scheduly-build-workflow/badge.svg)

Laravel/Vue reservation system for scheduling events and managing tasks related to them.

## Development

Currently working on the back-end implementation for managing reservations using TDD. I plan to build the main front-end component using a custom implementation of [dayspan-vuetify](https://github.com/ClickerMonkey/dayspan-vuetify).
