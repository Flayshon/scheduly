# Scheduly
![build](https://github.com/Flayshon/scheduly/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Laravel/Vue event scheduling system for scheduling events and managing tasks related to them.

## Development

Currently working on the back-end implementation for managing events using TDD. I plan to build the main front-end component using a custom implementation of the [Vuetify Calendar component](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/components/calendars/).
